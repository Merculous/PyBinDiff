# PyBinDiff
Usage: tool file1 file2

# Output
Output a json file containing hex data. The 1st or left side is the "file1"
hex data, whereas the other is the opposite. Should be simple enough.

# Using this code
Do whatever you want with it, I don't care. This is just something I've been wanting
to make myself. Will use it later on, maybe not, I was bored and made this.
